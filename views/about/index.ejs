        <p>Hey. My name is Vid Repar and I study Web Design and Development at SAE Institute. My focus is Node.js, using the tools built upon it: express.js, angular.js, mongoose.js. For the design part there is no fear for me of using Adobe Suite and Blender, but daily use include Photoshop and Illustrator for the most part. I enjoy the whole process of working on Web or Mobile projects and love to grow and develop, especially when huge challenges arise. I appreciate honest communication to create great experiences and enjoy working within amazing teams where I can use my skills to create meaningful solutions. <br/><br/>My career in the field started nearly 5 years ago in a small startup. Back then design was my main priority. Then there were some career shifts ahead but my drive for coding started to grow. I went back to college to study Landscape Architecture, attended National Coding Course and started handball youth coaching. In this period I gained National Web Developer Certificate and EHF Coaching License as a result of my interdisciplinary endeavours. I am “fluent” in programming, design, sports, architecture, organization and personal development. In these years of exploration I sharpened my sense of aesthetics and developed analitical thinking.<br>My focus is Web Design and Development and I’m currently studying it at SAE Institute to bring it on a higher level.<br>I’m open to group or individual projects as well as give helpful and honest advice if needed.</p>
